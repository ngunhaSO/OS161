OS161
=====

School work at the Evergreen State College:

Kernel development that the Evergreen State College somewhat follows Harvard University's OS 161 assignments.
I've implemented the following:
  Lock -- assignment 1, 
  Safe and unsafe thread -- assignment 2, 
  Simple system call -- assignment 3
